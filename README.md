# SoC
System on Chip (SoC), an advanced chipset technology that enables both modern computing applications  and traditional embedded systems applications. 

While most of the materials found on the internet are focusing on ARM-Cortex M architecture which is great for embedded systems learning, ARM-Cortex A tutorials are rarely found. 

For high performance computing applications, ARM-Cortex A and even more advanced architecture (e.g. ARM-Cortex X) are used in the SoC system. The areas that I'm interested in are SoC design methodology and design tool chain, especially how low level drivers and software tools generated code/APIs channeling to Linux operating systems. 

Luckily, I found two great introduction books from ARM's official website: 
1. Operating Systems Foundations with Linux on the Raspberry Pi. 
This book is very intuitive about understanding Linux operating systems concepts for a hardware engineer and how those great ideas are carried on a ARM Cortex A modern SoC hardware system. Efficiency and cost are two main drivers for hardware innovations, and a great part of this is how to seamlessly manage the hardware resources with the existing operating system. 

2. Modern System-on-Chip Design on Arm
This book covers a great detail of hardware architecture of ARM Cortex-A SoC, and it's practical that I felt I could build a cool processor and memory system that utilizes those advanced cache, interconnect, and I/O's ideas.

Some details of the ARM build process are also introduced in those materials. 

3. ESL enabled software driven SoCs design methodology
